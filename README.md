# The Sovereign Stack

**A high-performance, zero-knowledge biometric vault for elite operators.**

The Sovereign Stack is the foundational architecture for the Maximost ecosystem. It is designed to provide absolute data sovereignty, biological inviolability, and cognitive liberty.

## Core Pillars

### 1. TRINITY (Systemic Independence)
The architectural backbone ensuring zero-knowledge encryption, jurisdictional independence, and decentralized identity management.

### 2. TANK (Biological Inviolability)
The biological defense system. Protecting the user's physical vessel through rigorous telemetry monitoring, habit formation, and physiological optimization protocols.

### 3. NEO (Cognitive Liberty)
The mind. Leveraging advanced AI (Alexis-Intel) to provide high-fidelity research, cognitive auditing, and defense against the "drift" of the digital hive mind.

## The Architecture

*   **`apps/maximost-web`**: **The Command Center.**
    *   Home of **Blueprints** (The Architect) and the **Atom Ledger**.
    *   The primary interface for the operator.

*   **`apps/maximost-api`**: **The Ingest Engine.**
    *   Handles high-throughput telemetry webhooks (Terra, Stripe, etc.).
    *   Manages the "Handshake" authentication and data routing.

*   **`apps/alexis-intel`**: **The Research Hub.**
    *   The "Brain" of the operation.
    *   Hosts the **30 Sovereign Topics** and the Lexicon of high-fidelity research.
