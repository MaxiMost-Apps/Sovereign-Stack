# 👁️ THE VISION: SOVEREIGNTY

## 1. THE MISSION
To build a "Mission Control" for the human operating system. We are not building a habit tracker; we are building a **Biometric Operating System (Bio-OS)** that ingests data, analyzes performance, and optimizes the user's life.

## 2. CORE PHILOSOPHY
* **Sovereignty:** The user owns their data. No third-party trackers.
* **Anti-Fragility:** The system gets stronger under stress. It adapts to the user's failures (The Mirror) rather than shaming them.
* **Integration:** We bridge the gap between "Digital" (Code) and "Physical" (Biometrics/Habits).

## 3. THE METAPHORS
* **TITAN:** The interface. Strong, industrial, high-contrast, zero-latency. It feels like hardware.
* **PHOENIX:** The backend. It handles the "dirty work" of ingestion and data sanitization. It rises from the ashes of bad data.
* **THE AIRLOCK:** The deployment process. We scrub code before it enters the production environment to prevent contamination.

## 4. SUCCESS METRICS
1.  **Zero Latency:** Dashboard loads instantly (<100ms).
2.  **Data Integrity:** Biometric data is never lost, only sanitized.
3.  **User Agency:** The user feels like a Pilot, not a passenger.
